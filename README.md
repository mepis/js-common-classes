# js-common-classes

## Summary

Repository of common functions written in classes that are used in multiple projects. 

All classes extend the 'common' class in the common.js file. The common.js class provides functions that all js-common-classes use, such as error messages and console loggers. 

## Notes
All classes will be called the same name as the file name containing the class. Each file will only contain one class.
